        Hi! I'm <b> Daniel Marra</b>, a young and passionate <b>Software Developer</b>.
    <br>

    <i>  When I turned 18 years old </i>, I was confused about which career to follow, but as soon as I saw videos about programming and web development, the way the developers talked and helped each other and demonstrated how much they liked what they did, I was delighted.
    <br>
        Since then I study self-taught web development in search of becoming a developer as well.
        I never really thought about technology, how exciting and fun it is. Was it love at first sight, kind of cliché? Yes haha, but it's a fact.
    </p>
